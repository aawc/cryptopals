# Solutions to CryptoPals

## Strive to solve the problems yourself

I would encourage you to not look at the solutions here
when you are trying to solve the problems yourself.

Please consider not copying the solution verbatim or in
principal. It won't hurt anyone else, except you.

## OK, then why have you made the solutions public?

That's a good question.
Sometimes, it's useful to compare your solutions with another's
and that's my goal here.

## I have a question/suggestion

I'd love to hear from you. Please open an issue for that. Thanks!
